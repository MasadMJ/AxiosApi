Use Postman to see our Dispatcher API with Postman:
● Open a new account on the newsapi.org site and get your API key.
● Open Postman and create a new collection called &quot;News API&quot;.
● Create a new request within the collection called &quot;Get top headlines&quot; and
set the request method to GET.
● Set the request URL from the website found in this link
https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines (***THIS IS NOT THE
URL***)
● Send the request and make sure you received the proper response (you
can check in the link above how a response should look)
